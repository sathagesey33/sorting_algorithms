# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
  2 
  3 Sorting algorithms are essential tools in computer science used to arrange elements in a particular order. This repository provides implementations and explanatio    ns of various sorting algorithms in C program.

<li> Bubble Sort</li> - Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the     wrong order. The algorithm continues to do this until the entire list is sorted. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case.

<li>Selection Sort</li> - Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: the sorted and unsorted sublists. The a    lgorithm repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted sublist and moves it to the beginning of the sorted sublist. Selection Sort also has a time comp    lexity of O(n^2).

<li>Insertion Sort</li> - Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O    (n^2).

<li>Quick Sort</li> - Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array into two subarrays: eleme    nts less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the subarrays. Quick Sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n) and     is often the fastest sorting algorithm in practice.
